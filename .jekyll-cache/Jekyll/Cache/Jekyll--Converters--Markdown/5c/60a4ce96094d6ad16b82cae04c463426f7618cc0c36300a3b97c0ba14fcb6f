<p>Since I ended up having much of what I needed already laying around, I do not have a completely full bill of materials. But 16$ + some idk = approx 20$?</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Flash your ESP32. <a href="https://github.com/petrepa/ESPHome-Doorbell/blob/master/esphome_doorbell.yaml">Here is my ESPHome code</a></li>
  <li>Print the parts. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4227174">Thingiverse</a></li>
  <li>Solder the connections</li>
  <li>Assemble</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>
<p>Follow the connection diagram and solder the wires as follows. One note is that you have to mount the button in the case before you solder everything.</p>

<p>IRL examples</p>

<p><img src="Images/btn_rewire.jpg" width="62.5%" /><img src="Images/ethernet_connections.jpg" width="35%" /></p>

<h2 id="assemble">Assemble</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Print the parts and assemble your ESP32 in it.</li>
  <li>Unscrew the fisheye lens before you put the board into the front piece, and screw it back on again.</li>
  <li>Fasten the button.</li>
  <li>Thread the cable though the wall where you want to mount your doorbell and thread the cable through the back piece. I tried to seal things off a bit by filling the gap in the back piece with a glue gun.</li>
  <li>Mount the back piece where you want your doorbell.</li>
  <li>Make the final connections and fasten the front part of the doorbell to the back piece using the M3 screws. As you can see I used dupont wires to make connecting and disconnecting easy</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="home-assistant-scripts">Home Assistant Scripts</h2>
<p>When the doorbell gets pressed <a href="https://github.com/petrepa/ESPHome-Doorbell/blob/master/script_doorbell.yaml">a number of scripts</a> gets activated.</p>
<ul>
  <li>TTS gets sent to the Google Homes</li>
  <li>Our phones gets a notification</li>
  <li>A snapshot is taken and saved</li>
  <li>Selected lights flash blue to notify us visually</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER</h1>
<p>This project is to be considered as a work in progress.</p>

<p>The 3D-printed parts is not a finalized version, and should be improved. I welcome anyone to remix the designs and make this project better.</p>

<p>This revision of the ESPHome-VideoDoorbell is more of a proof of concept. All the pictures were taken the summer of 2019, and the doorbell has survived the Norwegian winter in Trondheim untill now. I havenâ€™t even fastened the front piece to the back piece, but it has still survived.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-improve">Things to improve</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3D models should be improved. The back piece should have room for threaded inserts.</li>
  <li>The push button should be a 3.3V (or something around that) so that the wire going to the doorbell only needs two chords. Then you would also only need one PSU instead of a seperate 12V just for the button.</li>
  <li>The push button should be a slimmer design. This enables the 3D models to be slimmer and have a lower profile.</li>
  <li>Some sort of sealing around the exposed parts of the ESP</li>
</ul>
